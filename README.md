# Introduction

A very simple escrow webapp which connects to the Ethereum blockchain.

## Development

### Smart Contract

- Install Truffle and Ganache.
- To run smart contract tests, run `truffle test`
- To deploy onto the local Ganache blockchain, run `truffle migrate --reset` for a fresh deployment. This resets the blockchain state.

### Web App

- Make sure to have Metamask installed on Chrome browser
- Run `npm start` to run the web app.
